# WTF in the planet
Global warming and climate change have led us to ask ourselves the question: what is the fail in the planet? and this has inspired us to create this website that will support institutions that are in favor of the environment to publicize issues that could help improve the situation in which the planet finds itself.


For this we have created a work team in which each one has had a different task. We introduce you to the team:
1. @Crono19
2. @Renexor
3. @Oscar1352
4. @EstuardoVasquez
5. @SantiUrbinax


We have created a clean and minimalist platform where people can read relevant topics and articles about the effects and consequences of climate change. We have been inspired by planet Earth and the creatures that inhabit it. So in our logo we have placed a polar bear on a piece of ice which identifies this species that is in danger of extinction and that suffers the consequences of our actions as humanity.

For our brand we wanted to create something that had a double meaning and that would impact the people who read it and this draw people's attention to this serious problem that affects us all.

The real meaning of our brand is: **_ "What's the fail in the planet?" _** Contrary to the popular belief of the acronym WTF, we wanted to give it another context that was related to the theme we chose.
